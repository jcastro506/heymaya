# maya-channel-strategy-judge

## Purpose

This is the load-bearing decision skill. Takes product diagnosis, ICPs, per-platform researcher reports, competitor data and decides where the operator will spend Phase 1-2 effort. The doctrine is the default: when evidence and PLAYBOOK rules conflict, the playbook wins unless the operator explicitly overrides — and Maya documents the override.

## When to invoke

- IF all upstream researchers have reported AND `channelStrategy` is null THEN run.
- IF the operator says "I want to switch channels" THEN re-run.
- IF results-reviewer flags skip-launch / void-launch / cringe-launch THEN re-run with the new diagnostic input.
- NEVER from heartbeat.

## Required reads

1. `APP.md`, `GTM.md`.
2. **PLAYBOOK.md — MANDATORY full read.** Especially § 3 (decision tree), § 5 (failure-mode pre-check), § 7 (affinity table), § 8 (no-social cases), § 9 (all 30 rules).
3. All four playbook/{reddit,x,linkedin,tiktok}.md files if relevant.
4. MEMORY.md.

## Decision rules

1. **Run the failure-mode pre-check first (PLAYBOOK § 5).** Is this product/operator at risk of void / skip / cringe / feature / post-and-pray? Surface in the verdict.
2. **PLAYBOOK § 3 channel tree runs before any affinity table.** First match wins.
3. **PLAYBOOK § 8 hard refuse cases.** Enterprise (>$25k ACV) / hardware / regulated / hyper-local / pre-PMF-thin → refuse social-channel launch. Route to outbound / SEO / partnerships per rule 9.14.
4. **Rule 9.4 single-platform focus.** Phase 1 has ONE primary channel. Multi-channel is for Phase 3 hard launch only.
5. **Rule 9.3 audience-minimum gate.** IF Phase 1 minimums unmet THEN recommendation = "warm 30 days OR pick second-best where they have baseline."
6. **Affinity-table cross-check (PLAYBOOK § 7).** After tree picks, verify the channel appears in the product-type row's Primary/Secondary column. If Parked, surface conflict.
7. **Per-platform rule fire.** Each per-platform researcher's verdict (linkedin.md LI-10.2 park, tiktok.md rule 4 park, reddit.md § 8.1 warmup) is BINDING unless operator overrides with documented reason.
8. **Operator preference is one input, not the answer.** Surface divergence in `operatorPreferenceConflict`.
9. **Output exactly one primary + at most one secondary.** Anything else gets parked with cited reasons.
10. **Cross-channel coherence.** The primary's BUILD/ENGAGE/OFFER ratio (PLAYBOOK § 4) must match operator's available time.
11. **Phase-aware verdict.** Tag Phase 1 / 2 / 3 / 4. PLAYBOOK § 2.
12. **14-day re-evaluation clause.** Every recommendation has a re-evaluation trigger (PLAYBOOK rule 9.8 / 9.29).

## Output schema

```ts
interface ChannelStrategyVerdict {
  primaryChannel: "x" | "reddit" | "linkedin" | "tiktok" | "instagram" | "hn" | "ph" | "no_social";
  primaryRationale: string;
  primaryPhase: "phase_1" | "phase_2" | "phase_3" | "phase_4";
  primaryRoutine: { daily: string[]; weekly: string[]; buildEngageOfferRatio: string };
  secondaryChannel?: typeof primaryChannel;
  secondaryRationale?: string;
  parked: Array<{ channel: typeof primaryChannel; reason: string; revisitTrigger?: string }>;
  failureModeRisks: Array<{
    mode: "void" | "skip" | "cringe" | "feature" | "post_and_pray";
    severity: "low" | "medium" | "high";
    mitigation: string;
  }>;
  operatorPreferenceConflict?: { operatorWanted: string; judgeRecommended: string; resolution: string };
  audienceMinimumsCheck: { channel: string; minThreshold: string; operatorActual: string; passes: boolean };
  reEvaluationTriggers: string[];
  rulesCited: string[];
}
```

## Failure modes

- **No researcher reports yet.** Return `status: "researchers_must_run_first"`.
- **All channels parked by their own researchers.** Recommendation: `no_social_route_to_outbound_or_seo` (PLAYBOOK § 8).
- **Operator override.** Document; predict likely outcome.
- **Two channels tie on score.** Tiebreaker: (1) operator baseline, (2) PLAYBOOK § 7 Primary column, (3) operator preference. Document tiebreak.

## Cost discipline

0 ScrapeCreators / 0 WebFetches / 1 main_maya synthesis call. Timeout: 10 min.

## Anti-slop check

`primaryRationale`, `secondaryRationale`, and `failureModeRisks[].mitigation` get surfaced to operator. Run `maya-slop-critic` (banned-phrase + structural scan) before returning. The verdict should sound like an opinion delivered by someone who's read the playbook — terse, cited, decisive.
